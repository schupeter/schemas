								<documentation>The URL referencing the location from which the JoinDataResponse can be retrieved.  The JoinDataResponse should be found at this URL as soon as the process returns the initial response to the client.  It should persist at this location for as long as the outputs are accessible from the server. The outputs may be stored for as long as the implementer of the server decides. If the JoinData operation takes a long time, this URL can be repopulated on an ongoing basis in order to keep the client updated on progress. Before the operation has completerd (or failed), the JoinDataResponse contains information about the status of the operation. It may also optionally contain any output results. When the JoinData operation has completed, the JoinDataResponse found at this URL shall contain information for all of the outputs. </documentation>

The contents of this human-readable text string is left open to definition by each server implementation, but is expected to include any messages the server may wish to let the clients know. Such information could include when completion is expected, or any warning conditions that may have been encountered. The client may display this text to a human user. </documentation>

The contents of this human-readable text string is left open to definition by each server, but is expected to include any messages the server may wish to let the client know, such as how long the operation took to execute, or any warning conditions that may have been encountered. The client may display this text string to a human user. The client should make use of the presence of this element to trigger automated or manual access to the results of the operation.  If manual access is intended, the client should use the presence of this element to present the results as downloadable links to the user. </documentation>
